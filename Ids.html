<!-- Ids in Html -->

<!-- In Html, Ids (identifiers) are attributes that are used to identify and select from
unique way individual elements on a web page. Each ID must be unique within a document
Html, which means that no other element should have the same ID on the same page. You can assign
Ids to Html elements for various purposes, such as styling them with CSS or accessing them through
JavaScript. Here is an example of how an ID is used in Html. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
     <title>HTML ID example</title>
     <style>
         #my-header {
             color: blue;
         }
     </style>
</head>
<body>
     <h1 id="my-header">This is a header with an ID</h1>
     <p>This is a paragraph without ID.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In this example. -->

     <!-- 1. A header (`<h1>`) is created with the `id` attribute set to "my-header". This gives you a
     unique identifier to the header.

     2. Css is used to select and style the header with the ID "my-header". The header
     It is shown in blue thanks to the Css rule applied. -->

<!-- It is important to note that while Ids are useful for styling or selecting
elements with JavaScript, it is recommended to use classes instead of Ids when you want to apply
shared styles or select multiple elements with similar characteristics. Classes can
be reused across multiple elements, unlike Ids, which must be unique. -->

<!-- Also, in Html5, the `<header>` tag has been introduced that can be used to create a
header without the need to assign a specific Id. The use of Ids should be reserved for cases in which
A unique Id is needed for a specific element on the page. -->
