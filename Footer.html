<!-- Footer in Html -->

<!-- The `<footer>` element in Html is used to define the footer section of a web page.
The footer usually contains information that is relevant to the entire page or to the section
to which it belongs. This may include copyrights, links to privacy policies, links to
contact, attributions, information about the author, or any other content you want to display on the
bottom of your page. Here is an example of how to use the `<footer>` element in Html -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Example of &lt;footer&gt;</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Page Title</h1>
        </header>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation bar -->
        </nav>
        <main>
            <!-- Main content of the page -->
        </main>
        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2023 My Company - All rights reserved.</p>
            <p><a href="politica-de-privacidad.html">Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="contact.html">Contact</a></p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

<!-- In this example, the `<footer>` element is used to contain copyright information and
links to the privacy policy and contact page. The content you place inside the
`<footer>` will be displayed at the bottom of the page, providing important information for
visitors to your website. -->

<!-- Using the `<footer>` element is a good practice to improve the semantics of your HTML code and
facilitate accessibility and understanding of content by search engines and
users. -->
