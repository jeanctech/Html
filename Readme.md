## Introduction

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial goal of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for now it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
