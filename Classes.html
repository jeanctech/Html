<!-- Classes in Html-->

<!-- In Html, classes are used to add style or behavior information to elements
Html. Classes allow you to select a group of elements and apply Css rules or behavior to them
specific using JavaScript. To define a class in Html and then apply it to an element,
follow these steps. -->

    <!-- 1. **Define a class:** Defines a class in the `<style>` element or in an external Css file.
    You can do it in the following way: -->

         <style>
            .my class {
                color: blue;
                font-size: 16px;
            }
        </style>

    <!-- In this example, we have defined a class called "my-class" that changes the color of the text to blue
    and set the font size to 16 pixels. -->

        <!-- 2. **Apply a class:** Apply the class you have defined to an Html element using the
        `class` attribute. You can add the `class` attribute to any Html element you want
        stylize or modify with class. -->

    <p class="my-class">This paragraph has the class "my-class" applied.</p>

    <!-- In this case, we have applied the class "my-class" to a paragraph, which will result in the change of
         Text color and font size according to the rules defined in the class. -->

    <!-- You can apply the same class to multiple elements on your page, making consistency easier
         in the design and format of your website. Also, you can have multiple classes on a single element,
         separating them with spaces, for example: `class="my-class another-class"`. -->

<!-- Classes are a fundamental part of the styling and structure of a web page, and are
widely used in combination with Css and sometimes JavaScript to add interaction to
The elements. -->
